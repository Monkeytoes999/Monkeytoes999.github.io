Since then, we have been operating without issue, <strike>if you don't consider weekly major lawsuits an issue,</strike> and our customer base has grown considerably.<br><br>Here are a few major reasons you may want to consider banking with Brazeltonz's:<br><ul><li>Our bank is securely backed by Gold bars provided to us by the all powerful lizard people, and stored securely in the caves of <i>Ivelvian</i>.</li><li>We offer massive interest rates on savings accounts, with interests as high as 80% based on how much we like you as a person.</li><li>As a relatively small banking chain, we won't bother you about stupid things like: having an insanely secure password for your account.</li><li>We offer amazing investment deals where you just tell us how much money you'd like to invest and we just estatic to handle everything for you.</li></ul><br>Additionally, we have an aversion to security guards. If we discover that you, or anybody that you know, is a security guard, we will instantly close your account and totally give you all your money back because legally we have to. Totally. Don't look us up in the news. It doesn't even matter what type of security guard you are. Museum? Account closed. Mall? Account closed. Your third uncle twice removed made you look at a baby monitor of his sleeping pig for half a second? Account closed. We take this very seriously, and we <i>will</i> find out.<br><br>Why would we behave this way? Well you see, the presence of security guards anywhere near the hydras we keep at all physical locations - and as of 2022 even in some web browsers! - will cause them to combust violently due to an overwhelming sense that they have been replaced by someone less deserving to guard our hoards of financial stock than they are. Some claim that such hydras do not exist, but we know better. Stu Brazeltonz himself personally instates each hydra, and some even claim he breeds them in his backyard.<br><br>For more information about Stu Brazeltonz, our founder, visit the dedicated page <a href = info>here</a></div>
