            <p><b>So here's the deal:</b></p> 
            <p>Have you ever looked for an amazing investment opportunity, but all those big money-hungry coroporations scared you off with empty promises like "You'll see a guaranteed increase within 14 days!"? Well let us here at Brazeltonz's Secure Banking make you a guarantee that you'll never have to worry about! (I mean, you're already banking with us, seriously it's just about as convenient as it possibly could be).</p>
            <p>Upon creation of an investment account with us here at Brazeltonz's Banking, we will automatically begin to use however much money you decide in the set-up phase to place bids on high-value investment items that are <i>completely sure</i> to rise! We can almost guaratee it, and it's totally not because we use shady business practices such as insider trading to guarantee our success, that would be rediculous.</p>  
            <p>Remember that amazingly eye-catching piece on the dashboard of your banking page, the one that probably brought you here to begin with? "<b>Consider opening an investment account with us!</b> Brazeltonz’s Banking has been nationally recognized for our excellent investment services! If you invest with us, you won't have to worry about market conditions! We'll handle your money for free!"</p>
            <p>Well that's more than just hot air - as long as you aren't using a CRT monitor (we're hilarious and yet still inaccurate, I'm well aware). No but seriouly if you are using a CRT monitor what in the world are you doing? We here are Brazeltonz's Banking aren't even convinced those things are real! When's the last time you touched one? Better yet - when's the last time you <i>ate</i> one? That's what we thought, and you can't change our minds, at least not without some significant financical compensation which we will be happy to take out of your bank account free of charge.</p>
            <p>At any rate, our investment opportunity is simply too good to pass up! When you're telling your more successful sister's great-grandchildren how much money you made while doing absolutely nothing and simply investing with Brazeltonz's Banking, they'll be sad that we aren't around anymore so that they can't open an account with us as well! Speaking of which, if you'd like to open a banking account for your upcoming grandchildren, please do so now and provide us with a $5000 deposit so that we can seek out those pesky little rascles and give them free accounts, no matter what name they may have, or what name we may be under at that time! We guarantee you'll never be able to make the connection because, well firstly you'll simply be senile by that time, and secondly we'll still be so unknown that you won't even understand that we're a bank in your old old senile state.</p>
            <p>Not sure that your more successful sister is ever going to have children to begin with? That's ok, we know. We did a DNA test on you while you weren't looking, unless of course your parents told you that you were an only child or that you don't think you have a sister for whatever reason. I mean we know the truth, you do and she's making significantly more money than you and for some reason we can't convice her to switch to banking with us, even though our salespeople asked her very nicely and didn't even try to slip in under her door while she was sleeping just to create an account on her computer. Anyway, she absolutely will have children, we've seen the future.</p>
            <p>I think we got a little bit off topic. Let's talk about investing with us. You should absolutely do it!</p>
            <p>Don't believe that we possibly could have seen the future because time travel is impossible by your current understanding of physics and also the current trajectory of science because like it's 2022 and we still don't even have flying cars? Well let me address the cars thing first - that's obviously just because if we had flying cars we'd also have flying car terrorrists. Like you know how easy it is to strap a bomb to a car and then have it hurtle into you're uncle's neighbor's garage while your arch enemy is spending the night in his bathtub? Not that you'd ever do that of course, neither would we, but those terrorists really like bombs. So imagine what would happen if the cars could fly - nowehere would be safe! We probably wouldn't even have any national monuments anymore because of simply how easy it would be to point your flying car in the general direction, hop out, and then tie a brick to the accelerator!</p>
            <p>And don't get me started on those people who are like "why don't we have hoverboards <i>Back to the Future</i> promised me hoverboards wah wah wah I'm a little baby and I'm too lazy to move my body so I want a hoverboard so I can just lazily do absolutely nothing all day and just hoverboard everywhere and like while you're at it make them as fast as cars so that I don't even need to get in my car and do work I can just sleep on my hoverboard while it brings me to work." Those people are the worst and we don't even know how they're employed. Seriously, one of our interview questions is "Are you mad about the fact that we still don't have hoverboards even though you were promised a hoverboard by some sci-fi movie not to be named due to copyright infringement even though nobody is listening to this converstation who shouldn't be even though aforementioned movie was really just trying to give you a little taste of entertainment in this boring human existence that we all must endure?" If you answer that one wrong we leave you a bad review on both Ebay and Goodreads.</p>
            <p>Anyway you should totally start investing today. Call your designated sales agent as referenced in the "Oh, so you wanna like, make money and stuff" packet mailed to your home when you first signed up.</p>
