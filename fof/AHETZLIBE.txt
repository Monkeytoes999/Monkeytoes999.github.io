Welcome back!

Hey look, I can't just give you the information the easy way. As you may have guessed by now (I have absolutely no idea how you possibly could have), this mess is a 35 project.
Your first experience with a 35 site. Super exciting right.
So anyway when I'm making these for the 35 I want it to actually be relevant to the thing I'm sharing with you at the end of it
That being said
Holy carpola do these first few not have a lot going on.
Don't get me wrong it's not like there's nothing to say about them, and it's not that they aren't important, but the things themselves aren't really great to demonstrate in code.
(That won't stop me from trying, get ready for some absolute garbage in the next couple days. Probably not tomorrow's project because I should actually put in more than two hours on the thing that I'm thinking of, but yeah)
This mini-series of pages is mainly going to serve as your first formal introduction to the people who are relevant to the project as a whole.
There's a link at the very very bottom of this mess of text to what I'm going to call our 'Glossary of People'.
Jon and Bert, you both will have an entry in there... at some point soon. 

(Also worth noting that these people will be listed under pseudonyms until a point in time when the general audience of this project meets the individual in person, or I tell them about the project (unlikely) and get their approval)
Elizabeth - Is it important that she's the first person you're meeting? Who knows.


- Mongo
