Well dang you're still here

Haha, I'm being very effective and doing a wonderful job coding new and engaging pages for you to explore, as you can obviously tell.
Expect the go back button to be a constant from now on, but obviously without the functionality that it's the only think you need to do on this page.
I guess it's techncially still more interactive than day two's, but not really. That one took me a lot longer and is more interesting.

We'll see.
Uh like I said, names are much much more questionable from here on out.
Like Petunia is still midly reasonable as an English word, but uh... this next one? Yeah uh....
if this one stumps Jon for longer than like, a day I'll rethink this page to be more helpful and maybe have more things to actually do.

With that being said,
AILLZ

Person template still hasn't happened uh
We'll see if I get more actual helpful things done tomorrow
