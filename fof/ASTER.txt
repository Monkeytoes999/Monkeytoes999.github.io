Aaaand you're back.

Pretty fast wasn't it. (Don't have taken longer than like, ten minutes on that one please, it would make me sad that I put in that little effort on this page and it still took a long time.)

Long video - https://youtu.be/PFyZ0nr_H44
Short video - https://youtu.be/qx8vh7ngmwc

Would recommend the short video, but I kinda rush through the things in that one. It gets the point across enough I think, and I'm not going to ask you to spend another hour of your time on these stupid things, but the long one is good optional watching I suppose.


Let me know if you want an official version of the timeline posted in resources, I can make that happen.
