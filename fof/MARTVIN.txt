Well hello there.

Um. Yeah. About those videos...
I have no idea what the heck is going on with these pages.
I come up with an idea in like, ten minutes, spend maybe an hour or two writing out the code for it, and then shove one of these documents in just to pretend that I'm being productive.
As of writing this I still don't have the peoples thing set up, which, you know, isn't really a big deal if nobody ever finds these little messages to begin with.
Something that I should have mentioned in yesterday's document that I didn't for whatever reason is that there are probably going to be a total of seven days of this, each giving you the name of a relevant person in these things.
Oh it's also nice to be doing this because now I can just bring up these people by name when they're relevant and if you really want to you can try to piece things together a bit better.
Anyway the names start getting a little bit less recognizable as names from this point forward. I mean, for a little bit just treating it as an anagram might still work for a bit but I might have to rethink delivery for a few of them.
